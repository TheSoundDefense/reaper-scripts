* adjust_note_velocity.eel - This script scales the velocity of all selected notes by the user-provided %. For example, selecting 50% will give all selected notes half of their current velocity (rounded down).
* adjust_note_velocity.eel - This script scales the velocity of all MIDI notes in the entire project by the user-provided %.
* select_notes_in_velocity_range.eel - This script selects all MIDI notes in the current track that have a velocity within the user-provided range.
* select_notes_with_velocity.eel - This script selects all MIDI notes in the current track that have the same velocity as a user-provided amount.
